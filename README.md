# SMVD-Super-Minecraft-Versions-Downloader-
Two Python scripts, which can download all versions of Minecraft(Classic, Indev, Infdev, Alpha, Beta and Release versions)!

This project does not include or distribute Minecraft game files.

All Minecraft versions are downloaded directly from official Mojang/Microsoft servers.

Minecraft is a trademark of Mojang Studios.

The user must own a legal copy of Minecraft to play the game.



HOW TO USE?

Open the folder in your favorite IDE (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.) and open these files there. Then open a terminal and enter the command "python download_versions" or "python download_oldversnap". Before this, in the "version_id" value, set the desired version of the game, up to which all versions will be downloaded!
